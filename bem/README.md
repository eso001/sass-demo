To run NPM Script example:
1. NPM install dependencies
2. Run 'npm run sass' in command line

Note: You may need to delete the output file before running command. I did not include the additional code to delete pre-existing build folders to simply the example.

Look in styles/components/login for an example of how to break out a component using BEM architecture.
