To run NPM Script example:
1. NPM install dependencies
2. Run 'npm run build-sass' in command line

Note: You may need to delete the output file before running command. I did not include the additional code to delete pre-existing build folders to simplify the example.

Look in styles directory to see an example of how to break out CSS into files.
