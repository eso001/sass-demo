To run Webpack example:
1. NPM install dependencies 
2. Run 'webpack' in command line 

Note: Webpack injects CSS directly into the Javascript it compiles. It does not output a css folder. 

Additionally, because Webpack is first and foremost a module bundler, it requires additional files/configuration settings like an input and output file even though those aspects of Webpack are not directly relevant to this exercise.
